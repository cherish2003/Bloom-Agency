Bloom Agency Website
This repository contains the source code for the Bloom Agency website, a stunning and interactive website built using React.js and SCSS with captivating animations.

The goal of this project is to showcase the creative capabilities of the Bloom Agency and provide an immersive user experience. The combination of React.js and SCSS allows for dynamic and responsive web development, while the animations bring life and excitement to the user interface.

Features
